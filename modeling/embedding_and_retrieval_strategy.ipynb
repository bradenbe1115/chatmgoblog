      "Do you think that means anything for Ohio State?No, but that doesn't mean we can't sit back and appreciate things while the Draft highlights are still taking submissions. You'll see the one where Josaiah Stewart puts Donovan Jackson on his ass at least five more times in your life, but whipping around future NFL tackle Caleb Tiernan will just fade into the \"oh yeah he was awesome\" firmament.I also think you're going to remember these events in the negative. One day you'll be watching a typical Power run gain its typical four yards and be mad that this thing is allowed to happen again, because for three years anyone who tried to block down on a Michigan defensive tackle was asking to irrelevantized by Mason Graham.(Top DT)(Top DT again)Tackle of the week, that, and every bit as good as the events that already have a spot saved on the all-time reel. His fellow Gift from the Football Gods also contributed some superfluous senior sendoff moments. I mean, you're not replacing the time he did this to the Joe Moore winners with the time he did this to the worst guards that Michigan's faced in a minute, but there's something to seeing a great artist quote himself live that adds to the value.I know there's been talk of Derrick Moore returning for a senior year, and that would be huge, but I put him with his DT classmates among the juniors who elicit feelings of nostalgia whenever he bull-rushes through a guy who's going to be paid good money to prevent this from happening. Here he is wrecking Tiernan while Stewart and Graham are also giving their guys the business.One of the reasons Moore has been less visible this year is Stewart's usually been opposite him, creating a Rashan Gary/Chase Winovich effect where the both are performing at an elite level and the guy getting getting the worse blocking gets to the quarterback first. In fact the comp to The Real Rashan Gary (not the one in your heads) that I made for Moore as a recruit has proven as exacting as it was controversial. How many ~270-pound guys are there playing in space like an outside linebacker?The above was also our What Happened to Makari Paige moment of the game—the only one.

      "He is the Makari Paige of the MBB team. Gets in position, inexplicably can't finish the play. And as a guy in the last year of his career, it's shocking to watch.— CATBOY HUSBAND @ NATIONAL CHAMPIONS (@sportsgeek42.bsky.social) November 25, 2024 at 7:13 PMYou're right there man: dunk it! Also: Makari Paige: always right there in the right spot. The corollary is so weird that I think we've lost sight of how valuable the original proposition has been to this defense. Paige was still out there getting practice at nickel when the other starters were out. The tentative tackling thing annoys, but sum appreciation level remains high.What about guys who will be here next year?While I was clipping plays that I might want in case Tiernan transfers to Michigan next year I noted the guy he struggled to block most was probably TJ Guy. This is because of the Uchean dip.Stewart is a master of hands, techniques, and setting up his block. Moore is the consummate power rusher who can build the rest of his game off of being so good at the most important thing. But TJ Guy is arguably their most complete pass-rusher. He needed the dip for Tiernan, but Guy is anything but a light edge. As this poor RT:As for DT, for near future purposes, I will say Rayshaun Benny has continued to be a perfect comp for Kris Jenkins, including the Mason Graham-ian way he can gamble on himself to make dangerous plays in the backfield. The following clip is a zone run, but a similar gamble to the way Graham comes upfield on blockdowns:When you do that you're technically not in your gap anymore. If your DT gets stuck at the line of scrimmage for any length of time so the running back can jets by him, you're outleveraged and giving up a chunk. This one was extra dangerous because it's Ike Iwunnah (who's relatively slow) traveling from the next gap and Ernest Hausmann (who's relatively small) playing fixer behind. Note that Ike traveled just fine and Ernest got to his spot clean, so even the gamble was covered, but also note this is Northwestern's offense and Michigan is in Cover Zero.I noticed Cover Zero several times in this game. Tell me the plan isn't to leave our DBs alone with OSU's receivers?Nah, I think Wink could get away with some of the things he never gets to use because they mess with things that quarterbacks in college haven't learned yet. This was a 3rd & long approach that Wink installed early in the season that got shredded by Texas and USC quarterbacks who were trained to throw at the obvious thing, not be suspicious of it. Lausch…isn't trained to see the obvious thing. When Michigan lines up with everyone in the box then drops into a Cover 3 shell while babysitting the dumpdown, not only does he not throw the quick seams this might open up; he doesn't have them at his disposal.Add a time limit before Stewart blows up your protection and all of the practice time spent preparing for a parade of CJ Strouds instead of a parade of Will Howards was satirically relevant. Northwestern did adjust in the 2nd half to find (but not hit) intermediate routes that punished Michigan's high-low. Lausch hit a couple of those under Walker for 3rd & long conversions that brought back bad memories of Martindale's disastrous reentry to college football, then missed a third and ran out of relevant drives.I also didn't think those were terribly designed coverages—one was a bad sign that Wesley Walker still doesn't have the Busts of Tennessee worked out of his system, the other might have been him playing super conservatively because giving up a 3rd & 13 to Northwestern probably won't lead to points.You've been asserting that Zeke Berry should be a cornerback from now on.Grading against Jack Lausch has its dangers. He is easily the worst quarterback Michigan's faced this season, perhaps the worst in the last four falls.* Since this exercise is about trying to project future results from these events, I have to make some unsound projections with our data. For example, I would not assume, going forward, that many teams are going to aim at their receivers' butts on fades.I will read more into the fact that Berry was able to stop on the hitch and then get right back on his receiver's hip after the double-move. Memories of Jyaire Hill spinning 360 degrees were still fresh to me. Also that throw was set up by the first play of and earlier drive. In both instances Northwestern is running Mesh, but Mesh always comes with an extra \"Outlet\" receiver to do with as you please.That \"O\" is usually a pre-snap read to take the free yards under soft coverage, or attack a press corner who gets too aggressive against a receiver he can't handle downfield. Northwestern took the free yards when they caught Berry playing too high over the \"O\" on the first snap of their second drive.WR at the topI assume the double-move off of that installed to attack Jyaire, but one would assume it would be equally effective against a nickel/safety who played his first snaps outside just this month. That it didn't get Berry was an ::eyes emoji:: moment for me.Another \"hey that's a heady cornerback play\" moment from Berry was when Northwestern tried to run a rub against him in the redzone.The low snap throws off the quarterback's timing a bit but that's irrelevant to the coverage. Berry has a fraction of a second to react to the cornerback turning inside on him before the slot's route to the flat interferes with him. This may be his nickel instincts coming into play, but Berry is on that slant with time to spare.Of course the If Lausch Was Good projection works both ways; there were a couple of minuses for Berry where I thought he was responsible for leaving receivers open at the sideline that a functional quarterback converts to first downs.I want Paige, the curl-flat defender, to be dropping under that because there are no other threats to their side, but Berry has no reason (other than \"Northwestern\" to be playing so far back: your Cover 3 \"deep third\" famously can't get to 7-yard outs, but 15-yard ones should be in the heart of the zone.Berry was also the nearest defender on a scramble drill that converts if Lausch has any kind of opposite-shoulder accuracy.That was more clear-cut—Berry was gambling that Lausch would stop and try to hit Henning inside the numbers. I imagine that's something he'll get a better feel for the more he plays outside; Berry's instincts as a nickel and safety right now are probably telling him to take away throwing lanes when the play goes off-script, when a cornerback's job is to take away the sideline.*[I looked up past FFFF charts and my answer is the time Indiana had to play Donaven McCulley under center. Hawai'i's Joey Yellin, Iowa's Deacon Hill, MSU's Katin Houser, Nebraska's Chubba Purdy, UConn's Zion Turner, and the RS freshman edition of Gavin Wimsatt, are, from best to worst, my other top contenders. I'd put Lausch in the middle of that group, IE Chubba-level.]Like Amir Hall did.As Brian said on the podcast, this was the game for Aamir Hall, whose athletic limitations were exposed against Oregon and Indiana—he'll need a lot of safety help next Saturday. But facing Northwestern's FCS-ass passing attack, the FCS All-American was predictably awesome. Here's that pick, which anyone but the Worst Quarterback Who's Actually a Quarterback I've Ever Charted doesn't throw.There's also his tackle on the most FCS of plays, the triple-option split flow that I personally associate with Slippery Rock.But you can also contrast the way Berry sat on the Mesh Outlet earlier with the way Hall played this hook after seeing Graham blow up the middle of the offensive line.As long as you're not put off from an athletic disadvantage, much of cornerbacking is a situational art. Facing guys more his speed, Hall was comfortable enough to read the receiver's hips and react to the attempt to come inside after a step outside. Gemon Green would make plays like that against the lower rung teams on Michigan's 2022 and 2023 schedules and I'd think he's finally becoming a star, only for his one no-help moment with Marvin Harrison Jr. to turn into a touchdown.Any takes from our first garbage time of the season?Ike Iwunnah gave me a great clip to show off his strength in next year's DTs preview. Had RPS been on this would have been an RPS play for Northwestern, which is running a stretch to the gap that the bottom DT (#70 Peter Simmons) just abandoned on a pinch move. It gets nowhere because Iwunnah, who's the backside DT, was able to get across a guard who lined up playside of him and fight his way into the gap that Simmons got himself sealed out of. Yes, Ike falls down in the process, but falling down *IN* the gap is fine and encouraged, since all it does is force the RB to bounce into an edge well-defended by Kechaun Bennett.#92 the top DTMichigan is going to take a necessarily hit at DT when The Gifts are gone, but between Benny, Pierce, Ike, and redshirting freshmen with good stories I don't think we're in for the kind of dropoff we went through when Glasgow and Hurst departed.We also got a couple of Jimmy Rolder moments. I didn't clip the one where he blitzed and blasted the offensive tackle because I'm still annoyed at Wink for running that blitz against Texas, but I clipped another JIMMY ROLDER SMASH play.#30 blitzingRolder's been mostly asked to play back thus far in his career, so that was the first time we got to see the Heavy LB side of him that was all over his recruiting profile. I also appreciated Hood's excellent coverage behind that blitz after giving up a long pass (the one Q-Jo fell down on) against Indiana.Speaking of young coverage guys and eligibility remaining, I'm a bigger fan of Mason Curtis's interception in the light of day.When I sketched out the play and it was just a deep cover three with both Hole defenders dropping to the line to gain.It's not the hardest thing to run, but trusting the true freshman with the more complicated zone that's more likely to be attacked paid off. Lausch is reading Hausmann and Q-Jo the whole time, not thinking about the opposite hole defender appearing in the deep middle third of the field. Good job, freshman.Also Jyaire Hill entered the chat wearing a new number and forced AJ Henning to play some cornerback.Hill wasn't the only young cornerback who appeared in a Double Super Secret Probational new number. The guy wearing #41 here is Jo'ziah Edmond.Translated from Lausch that's an interception if it's catchable, and some impressive length that will be hard to throw over once it's weaponized. Also: the fact that multiple cornerbacks had new numbers suggests this was more in the college hijinks bin than an issue particular to Hill.In case you're wondering who played in Kenpom Time, here's the lineup on the penultimate drive. The final drive had Pierce and Peter Simmons at DT, Hewlett at MLB, Sullivan at WLB, Jack MacKinnon at SDE, Breeon Ishmail at WDE, Andrighetto at free safety, Kody Jones at nickel, and Keshaun Harris in for Hill.Heroic?This was The Aamir Hall game. Plus Graham, Grant, Stewart, Moore, Benny, and Guy, as usual.Maybe not so heroic?This was not the Wesley Walker game.What does it mean for Ohio State and beyond?Northwestern is terrible at football and OSU should be embarrassed about making them look good. Mmmmm transitive quality.Zeke Berry can cornerback. His elite athleticism and his knowledge of the defense are both translating well—maybe nickel was just too much?Aamir Hall: FCS All-American. Played super-comfortable, made plays, no mistakes, probably not remotely applicable to Jeremiah Smith.Caleb Tiernan would look good in maize and blue. If he doesn't turn pro he should come home. This isn't based on any insider knowledge or nothing—I just think it'd be a good idea for him and for us.Priors: confirmed. Sorry, it's 48 snaps versus Northwestern, I've got nothing.YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN\n"
